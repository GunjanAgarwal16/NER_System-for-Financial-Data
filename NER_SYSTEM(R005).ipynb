        "# 1. Problem Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a crucial tool for extracting structured information from unstructured text. In this project, we aim to create an NER system to analyze financial reports of electronics companies, starting with Apple.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Context:\n",
        "The system processes reports such as:\n",
        "- **10-Q Reports**: Quarterly reports with financial performance.\n",
        "- **10-K Reports**: Annual reports detailing company performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Initial Setup:\n",
        "- The original reports were in **HTML format**.\n",
        "- Converted to **PDF** for processing using online converter.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objectives:\n",
        "1. Extract meaningful entities like:\n",
        "   - Company names (e.g., Apple Inc.)\n",
        "   - Monetary values (e.g., revenue, profit)\n",
        "   - Financial events (e.g., stock splits)\n",
        "   - Dates (e.g., fiscal years)\n",
        "2. Lay the foundation to scale the system for other electronics companies like Samsung and Sony.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Challenges:\n",
        "1. Financial text contains jargon, abbreviations, and technical terms.\n",
        "2. Preprocessing complex reports to remove noise.\n",
        "3. Starting with limited data (only two Apple reports).\n"

        "### Data Collection:\n",
        "1. Financial reports for **Apple Inc.** were obtained in **HTML format**.\n",
        "2. These HTML reports were converted to **PDF** using online converter for easier text extraction.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Preprocessing Steps:\n",
        "1. **Text Extraction**:\n",
        "   - Extracted raw text from PDF reports using PyPDF2.\n",
        "   - Combined text from both reports into a single dataset.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Cleaning the Text**:\n",
        "   - Converted text to lowercase for uniformity.\n",
        "   - Removed special characters and punctuation.\n",
        "   - Replaced common abbreviations with their full forms (e.g., \"$\" â†’ \"USD\").\n",
        "   - Removed stopwords like \"the\", \"and\", \"is\" for better focus on meaningful words.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Tokenization**:\n",
        "   - Split sentences into words for structured processing.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     - Raw: \"Apple Inc. reported revenue of $123 billion.\"\n",
        "     - Processed: `['apple', 'inc', 'reported', 'revenue', 'usd', '123', 'billion']`.\n",

        "### Observations and Errors\n",
        "1. **Partial Entity Recognition**:\n",
        "   - The trained model identified some entities, such as company names and monetary values, but missed or partially recognized others.\n",
        "   - Example:\n",
        "     Input: `\"Microsoft Inc. reported revenue of $123 billion, while AAPL stock surged by 5%.\"`\n",
        "     Extracted Entities:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     - Entity: Microsoft Inc., Label: ORG\n",
        "     - Entity: $123 billion, Label: MONEY\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     The entity `AAPL` was only partially recognized, missing the stock-related context.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Limited Dataset**:\n",
        "   - The model was trained on a small dataset comprising only two financial reports with manually annotated examples.\n",
        "   - This limited the modelâ€™s ability to generalize to unseen financial text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Annotation Challenges**:\n",
        "   - Manual annotation was time-consuming and error-prone, especially for complex financial jargon and domain-specific terms.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### Improvements and Future Directions\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Expand Dataset**:\n",
        "   - Collect additional financial reports from diverse companies and sources (e.g., SEC filings, news websites, earnings calls).\n",
        "   - Increase the variety of text formats and contexts to improve the model's robustness.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Automate Annotation**:\n",
        "   - Utilize weak supervision or semi-supervised learning for faster annotation.\n",
        "   - Use pre-trained models like `FinBERT` to generate initial annotations and refine them manually.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Improve Model Performance**:\n",
        "   - Fine-tune the system with domain-specific pre-trained models, such as:\n",
        "     - `FinBERT`\n",
        "     - Financial SpaCy pipelines\n",
        "   - Experiment with transformer-based models for better context understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Add New Entity Types**:\n",
        "   - Extend the system to include additional entity types, such as:\n",
        "     - Stock tickers (e.g., `AAPL`)\n",
        "     - Financial events (e.g., `mergers`, `IPOs`)\n",
        "     - Percentages (e.g., `5%`)\n",
        "   - Create detailed annotation guidelines for these entities.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Visualization and User Interface**:\n",
        "   - Enhance the Streamlit app to:\n",
        "     - Accept larger text inputs.\n",
        "     - Provide filters for specific entities.\n",
        "     - Offer interactive visualization with entity details.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Challenges**:\n",
        "   - Limited dataset and manual annotation hampered the systemâ€™s performance.\n",
        "   - Entity recognition was partially successful due to insufficient domain-specific training.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Key Results**:\n",
        "   - The system effectively extracted some entities (e.g., company names and monetary values).\n",
        "   - Entity visualization provided insights into their placement within the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Future Scope**:\n",
        "   - Automate annotations and expand the dataset for scalability.\n",
        "   - Transition to advanced transformer-based models for improved accuracy and contextual understanding.\n"
